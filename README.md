Final Project      
This game was made as a 3D FPS Zombie game using Unreal Engine. 
There are 5 waves of zombies in the game. In each wave, the zombies attack stronger and die harder. In addition, the number of incoming zombies increases with each wave. 

Between each wave, the player can go to the dealer to buy new weapons, armor and strengthen what they have bought. There are 5 different weapons and 3 different armor types in the game. Each weapon has different damage and rate of fire. The protection provided by each armor in the game is different from each other. Weapons and armor can be strengthened up to 3 times. 

The player receives the money needed to spend at the dealer from the zombies he/she kills. When the player's health or ammo is low, they can meet their needs by going to the first aid kits or ammo boxes located in various parts of the map. 

There are different types of sounds of the road, grass, and parquet in the game. So the player feels more natural. 

If the player does not die at the end of 5 waves of zombies, he/she survives and wins the game. If he/she dies, he/she loses the game. When the game is over, the players can see the scores they have achieved.
